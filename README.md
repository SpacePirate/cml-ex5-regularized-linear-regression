# Exercise 5: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance
In this exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to
study models with dierent bias-variance properties. Before starting on the
programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures
and completing the review questions for the associated topics.
<br />
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter
code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the
exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to
this directory before starting this exercise.
<br />
You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the 
Environment Setup Instructions" of the course website.
